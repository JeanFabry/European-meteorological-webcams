# Solo Project: European meteorological webcams
Made by [**Jean Fabry**](https://github.com/JeanFabry)

# What was asked ?
I was asked to create a website using [Windy API](https://api.windy.com/), which offers a clear weather overview of a particular european city of choice, and which had to include a costomizable page to compare the weather between different european cities at the same time. 

# What did I use ? 
* JavaScript
* HTML5
* CSS3
